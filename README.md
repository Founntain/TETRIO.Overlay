A simple overlay for displaying your Tetra League (TL) stats in OBS using a Browser Source. You can choose to display your stats as a static image or a live view that updates every 60 seconds.

If you find this overlay useful, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê to show your support, or share it with others who might enjoy it. Thank you for using it!

## üéñÔ∏è Usage

To use the overlay, simply use one of the following URLs:

**Base URL**: `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/<mode>/<username>/web`

### Tetra League
- **Live View**: `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/tetraleague/<username>/web`
- **Static Image**: `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/tetraleague/<username>`

- **Static Image**: `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/zenith/<username>`

### üìΩÔ∏è OBS Setup

For OBS, it is recommended to use the live view URL. To set it up:

1. Create a new Browser Source in OBS.
2. Paste the live view URL into the Browser Source settings, replacing `<username>` with your Tetr.io username (make sure to remove the `<` and `>`), the same goes for `<mode>`.
3. Make sure the width and height is correct check below what sizes are best for each overlay:
   - Tetra League: 900 x 300
   - 40 Lines: 700 x 225
   - Blitz: 700 x 225
   - Quick Play: 900 x 300

> **Note:** Ensure you use the URL ending with `/web` for live updates. The data is cached and refreshes every 30 seconds. For 40 Lines and Blitz the default cache is used which is **5 minutes**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Customization Parameters
You can put any parameters at the end of the url. ***The order does not matter, however spelling is!***

- **`backgroundColor`**: Adjusts the background color (useful if you don‚Äôt want a transparent background). Default is `00FFFFFF`.
- **`textColor`**: Changes the text color and the color of the progress bar. Default is `FFFFFF`.
- **`displayUsername`**: This only works for 40L and Blitz if set to `false` it will hide the username.

> **Example:** `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/tetraleague/<username>/web?backgroundColor=FF0000&textColor=00FF00`

## üè† Running Locally
