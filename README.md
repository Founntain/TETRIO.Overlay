> for more info check the [splits section](#Splits).

### üìΩÔ∏è OBS Setup

For OBS, it is recommended to use the live view URL. To set it up:

1. Create a new Browser Source in OBS.
2. Paste the live view URL into the Browser Source settings, replacing `<username>` with your tetr.io username (make sure to remove the `<` and `>`), the same goes for `<mode>`.
3. Make sure the width and height is correct check below what sizes are best for each overlay:
   - Tetra League: 800 x 350
   - Quick Play: 900 x 350
   - 40 Lines: 700 x 225
   - Blitz: 700 x 225
   - Speedrun splits: 1500 x 200

> [!NOTE]  
> The data is cached and refreshes every 30 seconds. For 40 Lines and Blitz the default cache is used which is **5 minutes**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Customization Parameters
You can put any parameters at the end of the url. ***The order does not matter, however spelling is!***

- **`backgroundColor`**: Adjusts the background color (useful if you don‚Äôt want a transparent background). Default is `00FFFFFF`.
- **`textColor`**: Changes the text color and the color of the progress bar. Default is `FFFFFF`.
- **`displayUsername`**: This only works for 40L, Blitz and Quick Play if set to `false` it will hide the username.
- **`modes`**: See [Slide section](#slide).

> **Example:** `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/tetraleague/founntain/web?backgroundColor=FF0000&textColor=00FF00`

## Splits

Ever wanted to know how fast you clear floors without hitting hyperspeed, or not able to hit hyperspeed ever, to see the splits in general? We have you covered. With the splits overlay, you can compare your times with your gold splits from this week.  
The splits overlay uses your last 100 games from the current week; all games past that aren't counted. We chose this limit because we don't want to make excessive API calls, and the last 100 games is enough to compare your performance this week. If you haven't played this week yet, we use your career best splits for display.  
With the `expert` parameter you can show the splits for expert or normal, default value is `false`

> [!CAUTION]
> The splits overlay is still very early and pretty complex. If something does not work as intended, or is not working at all, please let me know so I can look into it!  
> ***The splits overlay is not supported in slide mode, because it is quite large. Maybe in the future.***
