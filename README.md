# TetraLeague Overlay
A simple overlay to display your TL stats in OBS via Browser Source.
You can either get your stats as an image or as a live view that updates every 60 seconds.

If you like the overlay I would really appreciate it if you drop a ⭐ and show me that you like the work! Thanks for using it!

## Usage
You can access it by using the following url:
- For the live view: `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/tetraleague/stats/<username>/web`
- For a simple image: `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/tetraleague/stats/<username>`

For OBS use the live view one. Create a new Browser Source and paste it in and you are good to go. Just replace <username> with your tetr.io username

> The data is cached, so don't expect changes immediately the live view we updates every 60 seconds, but it only fetches the tetra channel API when the cache expired.

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues and request features, send feedback or report bugs or even contribute to the code base as well.
If unsure we can talk about it. Thanks
